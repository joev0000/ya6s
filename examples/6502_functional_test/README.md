# 6502 Functional Tests

These are the configuration files to run Klaus Dormann's 6502 and 65C02
functional test suites.  The source of the tests is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests).

Fetch the compiled binaries in the bin\_files directory of the repository
and move them to this directory, and run the simulator.
